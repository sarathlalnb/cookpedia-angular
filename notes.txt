Angular prvides two strategies for Building Forms.

1. Template-driven Forms
   - Simpler 
   - Logic is in the template using directives like ngModel.. etc.
   - Best for simple forms 
   - Angular automatically creates form object behind the scenes.

2. Reactive Forms(model-driven) -ReactiveFormsModule
   
   - More powerful,scalable and testable
   - logic is in the component not template
   - manually create FormControl,FormGroup etc



- Module :- are used to group components, not standalone components they are part of Modules.
            we can Lazy load modules in application.

   Lazy loading in angular:- Loading the components of webpages whenever it requires.It is used to reduce initial webpage loading time.

   - to create a module in ANGULAR with routing features :- ng g m moduleName --routing 
          - we will get routing.module.ts - used to setup paths/route of the component inside the module

          - we will get module.ts - Used to import common packages needed for components inside the module.
